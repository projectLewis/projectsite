Before I officially became a web developer, I spent 9 years in the Air Force. I spent the majority of that time as an Aircraft Loadmaster on C17As. Thats that giant plane in the background of my homepage. Shameless plug for <a href="www.instagram.com/lizrishel" alt="liz instagram">Liz</a> who took the photo on my last rotation down to the surface.  
<br>
<br>
It was a lot of fun, I had the pleasure of going to a lot of unique places. The signature location was Antartica supporting the National Science Foundation for Operation Deep Freeze. I made trips during the summer & the winter seasons. On one occasion bringing a <a href="https://www.af.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/1646436/rapid-antarctic-airlift-saves-lives/" alt="article about antartica medical evacuation">patient back from Antarctica</a> to New Zealand when the temperature on the surface was negative 62F.

I learned a lot in my time in the Air Force, and particularly in aviation. One of the big ones being practice. Annually, we'd have these evaluations called Checkrides. Where you get quized on some essential aspects of your job, and you have an evaluator follow you around over the course of a mission/flight and make sure you can perform your duties in a safe manor and within regulations.
<br>
<br>
This really got me in some good study habits, because you could also get one of those evaluations at any time (called no-notices), to make sure people didn't get lazy between required evaluation periods.
<br>

You get a lot free time in aviation during ocean crossings, so when I wasn't reading for leisure, or studying, I was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xu9tuLD5wcE" alt="practice by DJ Jazzy Jeff & J-Live">practicing</a> coding. Between flights I was coding, in the air I was reading. All that practice got me to where I am today.
