Before I became a web developer, I spent 9 years in the Air Force. I spent the majority of that time as an Aircraft Loadmaster on C17As. Thats that giant plane in the background of my homepage. Shameless plug for [Liz](www.instagram.com/lizrishel) who took the photo on my last rotation down to the surface.

It was a lot of fun, and I had the pleasure of going to a lot of unique places. The signature location was Antartica supporting the National Science Foundation for Operation Deep Freeze.
